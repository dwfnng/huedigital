"Enhance the overall design, user experience, and functionality of the website to ensure a smooth, visually appealing, and highly accessible interface for all users. The changes should be applied consistently across all feature pages while maintaining clarity and avoiding distractions. The improvements should include:

1. Overall UI/UX Enhancements:
Change the plain white background to a soft royal yellow with deep wood brown accents, evoking a sophisticated yet warm visual identity.
Add subtle imperial patterns or bronze drum motifs as a background texture on all feature pages to eliminate emptiness while ensuring readability.
Adjust color contrast and font styles to maintain text clarity and readability across different sections.
2. Improved Navigation and Page Transitions:
Enhance the navigation bar with refined icons, hover effects, and dropdown animations for better usability.
Implement seamless page transitions (fade-in, slide-in effects) to create a more immersive and fluid browsing experience.
Optimize internal linking and back navigation, making it easier for users to move between pages without confusion or unnecessary clicks.
3. Game-Based Learning (Educational Games) Optimization:
Fix text display issues where text overflows outside the content frame.
Redesign the game layout to make it more compact, organized, and visually appealing, avoiding oversized elements that reduce efficiency.
Ensure that interactive elements and buttons are intuitive and accessible on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Improve animations and responsiveness to provide a smooth gaming experience without lag or unresponsive controls.
4. Mobile & Accessibility Optimization:
Refine the responsive design to ensure a consistent experience on all screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.
Improve contrast, font sizes, and spacing for better readability and accessibility for visually impaired users.
Optimize touch interactions and navigation for mobile users.
Apply these improvements across all feature pages, ensuring a harmonious design, enhanced usability, and better engagement while avoiding distractions or unnecessary complexity."
